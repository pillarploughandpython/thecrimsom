        <p>It’s a fact that students in the lowest income quartile constitute less than 4% of enrollment at the nation’s
            most selective institutions. Among the many possible explanations, one of the most-talked about reasons is
            the theory of undermatching. In layman’s terms, this is the phenomenon when academically talented, low
            income students who could succeed at top colleges aren’t applying to, enrolling in, or graduating from them.
            Recent analysis, however, suggests that perhaps this theory isn’t as sound as we all seem to think.</p>

        <p>A study done by Michael N. Bastedo and Allyson Flaster of the University of Michigan presents three key flaws
            in current research on undermatching. For one, they said, the research ignores an important choice that
            disadvantaged students frequently make between community colleges and four-year institutions, of which they
            prefer the former. Secondly, researchers often erroneously assume that they can predict which students would
            be admitted to a top college if they applied. Finally, researchers also wrongfully assume that a high SAT
            score and a purely meritocratic admissions process would close the gap for disadvantaged students.</p>

        <p>March has come to a close, and with it has come a bulk of college decision letters. While many will
            undoubtedly be celebrating, many will also undoubtedly be angry and disappointed with the news they have
            received.</p>

        <p>To those who belong to the latter group, I say: I’m sorry. I get it. I feel you.</p>

        <p>You scoff. Perhaps you look at my byline and (rightly) conclude that I am a Harvard student. By most people’s
            definition, I won the college admissions game show. What makes me qualified to offer advice and condolences
            to students who are struggling with the news they’ve received this week?</p>

        <p>I’ll let you in on a little secret.</p>

        <p>Harvard students get rejected too.</p>

        <p>A lot.</p>

        <p>By this time, you should have received most if not all of your college decisions. Some of you may feel really
            happy about your decisions while others may feel understandably dejected. Regardless of how you feel, you
            now need to go forward with the next step of this college process. So after getting over the initial
            excitement or disappointment of your offers, you have to take the time to decide where you will end up. This
            decision is not one you can take lightly, so before you declare where you want to spend your next four
            years, here are some things to consider.</p>

        <p><b>Your Financial Aid Package: </b>The amount of financial aid you can receive from an institution can be the
            main reason you decide to go to one college over another. When you receive your package, check over the all
            details to make sure you understand it all. Especially take note of: 1) how much the college is giving you,
            2) how are they giving you the support (i.e. scholarships or loans), and 3) how much you are expected to
            contribute. Misreading your financial aid package could mean missing vital information that could alter your
            decision. If you discover that your package is inaccurate or less than what you might need, talk immediately
            to someone from your college’s financial aid office or change your package to something more suitable for
            you. A bad package can turn a dream school into a nightmare.</p>

        <p>Congratulations, Harvard Class of 2018! At last, the wait is over: the long nights of tweaking your Common
            App essay, the nervous weeks leading up to today, the anticipation as you constantly refreshed your inbox,
            and the spark of both excitement and dread that made your stomach jump the moment the email actually
            appears.</p>

        <p>Amidst the excited yells, the hugs and congratulations, you'll find yourself thinking about your life here at
            Harvard. Maybe you're looking forward to "pahking yah cah in Hahvahd Yahd" as you arrive to move in to your
            new home and meet all the other freshmen just like you. You'll all be curious, perhaps a little scared, but
            excited to be starting a new chapter of your life at such a beautiful, historic, and prestigious place.</p>

        <p>Maybe you're looking forward to late night conversations about aldol condensations and the latest posts on
            your favorite tumblr blogs, debates about the merits of capitalism and whether Berryline is better than
            Pinkberry, or even the constant searches for people who share your interests, intellectual and
            otherwise.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you can't wait to meet all your professors, inviting them to dinners or being invited into their
            homes for dinners instead. You'll spend hours discussing the newest scientific article that really caught
            your attention and work with them on projects you both are passionate about. You'll come in to talk to them
            about your passion for a subject you never knew you even liked.</p>

        <p>Maybe you'll explore and see all Harvard has to offer. You'll wander through the Harvard libraries,
            discovering hidden gems you never knew were there. You'll take a class on the History of Art and
            Architecture, intensive Russian, the Science of Cooking, Justice, Anton Chekhov, and even organic chemistry.
            You can't wait to see where your interests and passions take you.</p>

        <p>Or maybe you'll make memories. Your first of four Harvard-Yale games—maybe even your first football game
            ever! The excitement and nervousness leading up to Housing Day, then the bliss of finding that your assigned
            House has really and truly become your home. Jammin' out at Yardfest to the tunes of Janelle Monae. Spending
            late nights in the Crimson or the radio station, just to hang out with your friends.</p>

        <p>Whatever you're looking forward to, welcome to Harvard, Class of 2018. We can't wait to meet you.</p>

        <p>A revolution quietly took place during these first few months of 2014, changing the face of standardized
            testing. The next day, the evidence of the brawl was spread across the Internet, lining the pages of
            newspapers- the SAT had been completely overhauled.</p>

        <p>According to a <a
                href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/more-students-are-taking-both-the-act-and-sat.html?_r=0">NYTimes
            article</a>, as of 2013, the ACT had won the testing race, with 1,666,017 students taking it, versus
            1,664,479 for the SAT. It has become the clear favorite of harried and stressed high schoolers looking for
            their golden ticket to college <a
                    href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/04/education/edlife/where-the-sat-and-act-dominate.html">across
                the country</a>.</p>

        <p>That isn’t to say that the SAT has stopped growing; rather, both tests have seen spikes in the number of
            participants, with the ACT simply pulling in more. It seems that students are trying to make sure that they
            have done all they can to get into their university of choice. Perhaps an extra grade, a solid score on the
            ACT can push them over the hump and through the admissions door. This played a role in prompting the newly
            announced changes to the SAT format.</p>

        <p>Have you heard? The SAT is changing! Everyone panic!</p>

        <p>There has been a lot of publicity surrounding the recently announced changes to the College Board’s perennial
            pain-in-the-butt. College students and alumni around the nation are indignant that younger generations will
            not have to suffer through painful analogies, senseless vocabulary words like “grandiloquent,” and an essay
            graded more on the use of semicolons and complex adjectives than its content or structure. We suffered—why
            shouldn’t they?</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, high school students and parents are in a frenzy. “Does this mean I can’t prepare for the test!?”
            “What will become of my years of test prep!?” “Does Kaplan’s Higher Score guarantee still apply!?” Most
            likely, all of these reactions are unnecessary. While the announced changes certainly <i>sound </i>like the
            beginnings of a paradigm-shift, the reality is that the “new” SAT promises to be more of the same.</p>

        <p>In case you haven’t followed, the College Board recently announced several changes to the new SAT, which will
            start in the spring of 2016. Among these changes are:</p>

        <p>One hundred and eleven institutions of higher learning, including Harvard, have made changes to their
            financial aid instructions after the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government
            Reform alleged they were potentially <a
                    href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/7/harvard-financial-aid-congress-violation-alledged/">misleading
                financial aid</a> applicants.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/uploads/2014-02-03%20EEC%20to%20Secretary%20Duncan.pdf">letter</a>
            to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan '86 in early February, Maryland Congressman Elijah E. Cumming
            expressed concern that many universities were not making it clear to applicants that the CSS/Financial Aid
            PROFILE is used only for purposes of institutional aid, while the FAFSA is used only for determining federal
            aid.</p>

        <p>The Committee’s investigation indicated that Harvard’s financial aid instructions informed applicants to fill
            out the FAFSA and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE “without any explanation of use or purpose.”</p>

        <p>Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid made <a
                href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/19/after-accusations-of-misleading/">changes</a> to its
            online instructions approximately a week after being identified in the report to clarify the purpose of each
            form.</p>

        <p>In another <a
                href="http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/uploads/2014-02-03%20EEC%20to%20Secretary%20Duncan.pdf">letter</a>
            to Duncan on Monday, Cummings wrote that he was pleased that all universities cited in the initial letter
            clarified their aid instructions.</p>

        <p>“The changes made by these institutions demonstrate a commitment to ensuring that students receive
            appropriate instructions when applying for financial aid,” Cummings wrote.</p>

        <p>Are the SAT and ACT too distanced from the current work of high school students? This question has been
            debated for a while, but with the recent changes to the SAT, the president of the College Board, David
            Coleman, has also joined the discussion.</p>

        <p>But does this issue of the SAT and ACT's "irrelevance" entirely miss the point of these tests? If, as the
            College Board claims, the SAT and ACT are designed to test general knowledge, then the purpose of these
            tests does not need to closely resemble what schools teach students. If test-makers want to use these exams
            to tell college admissions officers something about “natural intelligence,” then the tests should not be
            expected to closely resemble what students learn in school at all.</p>

        <p>The announcement of the new SAT brought to the forefront many of the dissatisfactions that students, teachers
            and parents have with the standardized exams: they can be “gamed.” The content of the test, as it currently
            stands, favors those who can afford a tutor to teach them the tricks of the test, or who can afford to take
            them multiple times. This is the glaringly identifiable problem with standardized testing today. The new
            changes are meant to combat this issue by tying the SAT more closely to the materials the general high
            school curriculum.</p>

        <p>According to a recent report released by the College Board on Feb. 11, the number of high school students
            taking Advanced Placement exams has been consistently increasing over the past 10 years.</p>

        <p>Of the high school students graduating in 2013, 1,003,430 have taken one or more of the AP exams, compared to
            the 514,163 students in the high school class of 2003. The number of AP Exams taken has more than doubled in
            the interim, rising from 1,328,511 in 2003 to 3,153,014 in 2013.</p>

        <p>There has been an even more significant—to be precise, 371.65%—increase in the number of AP examinees from
            low-income families, which has risen from 58,549 to 275,864 since 2003. However, the expansion of access to
            AP exams is still an ongoing effort.</p>

        <p>With its well-intended changes, the SAT seems to have unconsciously alienated the international community of
            high school students who wish to pursue an education in the US.</p>

        <p>According to an announcement made early Wednesday afternoon by David Coleman, President of The College Board,
            the SAT will undergo major changes starting in the spring of 2016. Amidst changes including an optional
            writing section and the return of the overall scoring to a 1600 scale, one key change will have a profound
            effect on international students.</p>

        <p>As stated in the New York Times, “Every exam will include a reading passage from either one of the nation’s
            ‘founding documents,’ such as the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, or from a "global
            conversation" of such texts, such as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail.’”
            For an international student, this will have frightening implications for those of us who have not studied
            American history or literature.</p>
